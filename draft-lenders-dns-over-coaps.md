--- abstract

This document defines a protocol for sending DNS messages over the
DTLS-Secured Constrained Application Protocol (CoAPS). Using the REST
architecture specified in CoAP and the security features of DTLS, DNS over
CoAPS provides encrypted DNS messages for constrained devices in the
Internet of Things (IoT) based on common interfaces.

Introduction
============

With DNS over HTTPS {{?RFC8484}} (DoH) a confidential transport for DNS messages
was specified. However, the use cases provided in that document, preventing
on-path devices to interfere with DNS operations and getting safe and consistent
access to DNS information within the application space also apply for
constrained devices. The constraints on these types devices {{?RFC7228}}
typically do not allow for a HTTPS deployment. The Constrained Application
Protocol (CoAP) {{!RFC7252}}, on the other hand, provides RESTful APIs for such
devices, including a secure version over DTLS {{!RFC6347}}, CoAPS.

This document defines a protocol, DNS over CoAPS (DoC), to send DNS {{!RFC1035}}
queries and get DNS responses via CoAPS (including DTLS security for integrity
and confidentiality). Each DNS query-response pair is mapped into a CoAP message
exchange.

Compared to DNS over DTLS {{?RFC8094}}, advantages of CoAP can be utilized:
Block-wise transfer allows to solve the Path MTU problem of DNS over DTLS (see
{{?RFC8094}}, section 5) and an additional level of Caching is provided at CoAP
proxies. The economic use of memory resources key on constrained nodes: With
DNS over CoAP applications are re-use the same communication end-point for both
application traffic as well as retrieving DNS information.

This document also discusses additional feature sets of CoAP/CoRE to deploy and
gather DNS information such as resource discovery.

Terminology
===========

A server that provides the service specified in this document is called a "DoC
server" to differentiate it from a classic "DNS server". Correspondingly, a
client using this protocol to retrieve the DNS information is called a "DoC
client".

The term "constrained nodes" is used as defined in {{?RFC7228}}.

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

Selection of a DoC server
=========================
A DoC client is configured with a URI Template {{!RFC6570}}. This allows us to
reuse configuration mechanisms provided for DoH. Likewise, MAY a DoC server
support more than one URI Template to provide different properties.

The URI Template SHOULD provide a variable "dns" so that GET requests can be
used to retrieve the DNS information. If the "dns" variable is not provided in
the URI Template, GET requests can not be used for DoC exchanges.

TBD: DoC server identity, key exchange, ...

URI template alternatives
-------------------------
TBD:

- CRI {{?I-D.ietf-core-href}} or CoRAL {{?I-D.ietf-core-coral}}

CoAP Messaging
==============

Queries
-------

A DoH client encodes a single DNS query in one or more CoAP request messages
using either the CoAP GET, FETCH {{!RFC8132}}, or POST method. More than one
CoAP request message MAY be used if the FETCH or POST method is used and
block-wise transfer {{!RFC7959}} is supported by the client. If more than one
CoAP request message is used to encode the DNS query must be chained together
using the Block1 option in those CoAP requests. To make use of the recovery
mechanism of CoAP, the CoAP request SHOULD be carried in a Confirmable (CON)
message.

For a POST or FETCH request the URI Template specified in
[](#selection-of-a-doc-server) is processed without any variables set. For a GET
request the URI Template is extended with the "dns" variable set to the content
of the DNS query, encoded with `base64url` {{!RFC4648}}.

If new Content Formats are specified in the future, the specification MUST
define the variable used in the URI Template with that new format.

For POST and FETCH methods, the DNS query is included in the payloads of the
CoAP request messages in the binary format as specified in {{!RFC1035}} and
Content Format option MUST be included to indicate the message type as
"application/dns-message". Due to the lack of encoding requirements, both FETCH
and POST methods are generally smaller than GET requests.

A DoH server MUST implement both the GET and POST method and MAY implement the
FETCH method.

Using GET enables CoAP proxies en-route to the DoC server to cache a successful
response.
However, as the DNS query is carried in the URI and thus in one of the URI-\*
options within a GET request, block-wise transfer can not be used with that
method.
As a cache-friendly alternative, the FETCH method can be used, which is an
extension to legacy CoAP, specified in {{!RFC8132}}.

Requests of either method type SHOULD include an Accept option to indicate what
type of content can be parsed in the response. A client MUST be able to parse
messages of Content Format "application/dns-message" regardless of the provided
Accept option. Messages of that Content Format are DNS responses in binary
format as specified in {{!RFC1035}}.

To simplify cache-key calculations at the CoAP proxies en-route, DoH clients
using Content Formats that include the ID field from the DNS message, such as
"application/dns-message", SHOULD use DNS ID 0 in every DNS query. The CoAP
message ID takes the same function on the CoAP layer. Dedicated identification
of DNS message exchanges on the wire is thus not necessary.

It is RECOMMENDED that servers set an ETag option on large responses (TBD: more concrete guidance) that have a short Max-Age relative to the expected clients' caching time.
Thus, clients that need to revalidate a response can do so using the established ETag mechanism.
<!--
With short responses, a usable ETag might be almost as long as the response.
With long-lived responses, the client does not need to revalidate often.
-->
With responses large enough to be fragmented,
it's best practice for servers to set an ETag anyway.


### Request Examples

These examples request resolve an IN AAAA record from a DoC server identified by
the URI template "`coaps://[2001:db8::1]/{?dns}`".

The body is encoded in "application/dns-message" Content Format.

First, a GET request to resolve "example.org" is shown:

    GET coaps://[2001::db8::1]/
    URI-Query: dns=AAABIAABAAAAAAAAB2V4YW1wbGUDb3JnAAAcAAE
    Accept: application/dns-message

The same DNS query for "example.org" as a POST request:

    POST coaps://[2001::db8::1]/
    Content-Format: application/dns-message
    Accept: application/dns-message
    Payload: 00 00 01 20 00 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 07 65 78 61 [binary]
             6d 70 6c 65 03 6f 72 67 00 00 1c 00 01 c0 0c 00 [binary]
             01 00 01                                        [binary]


With FETCH the query is identical to the POST request, just with the FETCH
method used:

    FETCH coaps://[2001::db8::1]/
    Content-Format: application/dns-message
    Accept: application/dns-message
    Payload: 00 00 01 20 00 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 07 65 78 61 [binary]
             6d 70 6c 65 03 6f 72 67 00 00 1c 00 01 c0 0c 00 [binary]
             01 00 01                                        [binary]


Responses
---------
This document specifies responses of Content Format "application/dns-message"
which encodes the DNS response in the binary format, specified in {{!RFC1035}}.
For this type of responses, the Content Format option indicating the
"application/dns-message" format MUST be included.
A DoC server MUST be able to parse requests of Content Format
"application/dns-message".

Each DNS query-response pair is mapped to a train one or more of CoAP
request-response pairs. If supported, a DoC server MAY transfer the DNS response
in more than one CoAP response using the Block2 option {{!RFC7959}}.

### Response Codes and Handling DNS and CoAP errors

A DNS response indicates either success or failure for the DNS query. As such,
SHOULD CoAP responses carrying any valid DNS response, use a 2.xx Success
response code. GET and FETCH requests SHOULD be responded to with a 2.05 Content
response. POST requests SHOULD be responded to with a 2.01 Created response.

CoAP responses with non-successful response codes MUST NOT contain any payload
and may only be used on errors in the CoAP layer or when a request does not
fulfill the requirements of the DoC protocol.

For consistency, communications errors with an upstream DNS server such as
timeouts SHOULD be indicated with a SERVFAIL DNS response in a successful CoAP
response.

A DoC client might try to repeat a non-successful exchange unless otherwise
prohibited. For instance, a FETCH request MUST NOT be repeated with a URI
Template for which the DoC server already responded with a 4.05 Method Not
Allowed, as the server might only implement legacy CoAP and does not support the
FETCH method. The DoC client might also elect to repeat a non-successful
exchange with a different URI Template, for instance, when the response
indicates an unsupported content format.

### Examples

This section shows examples for successful and unsuccessful queries for the IN
AAAA record for "example.org" with recursion turned on. Successful responses
carry one answer record with address 2001:db8:1::1:2:3:4 and TTL 58719.

First, a successful response to a GET or FETCH request:

    2.05 Content
    Content-Format: application/dns-message
    Max-Age: 58719
    Payload: 00 00 81 a0 00 01 00 01 00 00 00 00 07 65 78 61 [binary]
             6d 70 6c 65 03 6f 72 67 00 00 1c 00 01 c0 0c 00 [binary]
             1c 00 01 00 01 37 49 00 10 20 01 0d b8 00 01 00 [binary]
             00 00 01 00 02 00 03 00 04

The successful response to a POST request just uses a different response code:

    2.03 Created
    Content-Format: application/dns-message
    Max-Age: 58719
    Payload: 00 00 81 a0 00 01 00 01 00 00 00 00 07 65 78 61 [binary]
             6d 70 6c 65 03 6f 72 67 00 00 1c 00 01 c0 0c 00 [binary]
             1c 00 01 00 01 37 49 00 10 20 01 0d b8 00 01 00 [binary]
             00 00 01 00 02 00 03 00 04

When a DNS error (SERVFAIL in this case) is noted in the DNS response, the CoAP
request still indicates success:

    2.05 Content
    Content-Format: application/dns-message
    Payload: 00 00 81 a2 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 07 65 78 61 [binary]
             6d 70 6c 65 03 6f 72 67 00 00 1c 00 01          [binary]

On a CoAP layer error, the DoC server SHALL respond with an appropriate CoAP
error, for instance "4.15 Unsupported Content-Format" if the Content Format
option in the request was not set to "application/dns-message".

CoAP/CoRE Integration
=====================

Proxies and caching
-------------------
- responses SHOULD have Max-Age option (set to minimum TTL from DNS response)
- Cache SHOULD support FETCH ("the request body is part of the cache key"
  {{!RFC8132}})
- General CoAP proxy problem, but what to do when DoC server is a DNS proxy,
  response came not yet in but retransmission by DoC client was received (see
  {{rt-problem}})

      DoC client           DoC proxy           DNS server
           |  CoAP req [rt 1]  |                    |
           |------------------>|  DNS query [rt 1]  |
           |                   |------------------->|
           |  CoAP req [rt 2]  |                    |
           |------------------>|      DNS resp      |
           |     CoAP resp     |<-------------------|
           |<------------------|                    |
           |                   |                    |
{: #rt-problem CoAP retransmission (rt) is received before DNS query could have been
fulfilled.}

OBSERVE (modifications)?
------------------------
- DoH has considerations on Server Push to deliver additional, potentially
  outstanding requests + response to the DoC client for caching
- OBSERVE does not include the request it would have been generated from ==>
  cannot be cached without corresponding request having been send over the wire.
- If use case exists: extend OBSERVE with option that contains "promised" request
  (see {{?RFC7540}}, section 8.2)?
- Other caveat: clients can't cache, only proxys

OSCORE
------
- TBD
- With OSCORE DTLS might not be required

URI template configuration
==========================
- Maybe out-of-scope?
- DHCP and RA options to deliver? {{?I-D.peterson-doh-dhcp}}
- CoRE-RD {{?I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory-28}}...

Considerations for Unencrypted Use
==================================
- DTLS-transport should be used
- Non-DTLS can have benefits: Blockwise-transfer for IEEE 802.15.4, additional
  layer of caching, ...

Security Considerations
=======================

TODO Security


IANA Considerations
===================

IANA is requested to assign CoAP Content-Format ID for the DNS message media
type in the "CoAP Content-Formats" sub-registry, within the "CoRE Parameters"
registry {{!RFC7252}}, corresponding the "application/dns-message" media
type from the "Media Types" registry:

Media-Type: application/dns-message

Encoding: -
